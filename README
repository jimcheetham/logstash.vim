logstash.vim highlights configuration files for logstash, a tool for managing events and logs (see http://logstash.net)

This script also includes custom filetype detection for logstash files, since they end with a generic extension. For it to take effect automatically, your configuration file must end with ".conf" and the first line must look like "input {".
